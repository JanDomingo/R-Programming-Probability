#1A: Generate 10,000 variates using the random number generator
#Generate random variates according to the RANDU generator

}
x = x[2:(n+1)] #Disregards seed value, keeps the other 10000 from for loop
u = x/(2^31-1)  #Transforming uniform variates between 0 and 1


#1B: Draw a historgram of these variates
par(mfrow = c(2,1)) #2 rows, 1 column for the graph matrix
hist(u, main="", xlab="RANDU variates", ylab="Frequencies") # histogram of the n RANDU variates


#1C: Draw the empirical cumulative distribution function against the CDF
plot.ecdf(u, verticals=TRUE, do.p = FALSE, main="", ylab="Probability")

#2C: Present a histogram of your variates
